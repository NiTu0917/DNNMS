# DCNNMS
Prediction of Drug-Target Interactions Based on Dual Convolutional Neural Networks and Multi-Head Self-Attention

# Data
Two datasets, C.elegans and Human, were selected, and each dataset contained nodes of drugs and targets. For drugs, we extracted corresponding the physicochemical property feature vector and ECFP fingerprint feature vector. For targets, we extracted the corresponding dipeptide composition feature vector and Word2Vec feature vector.

# Requirements
python = 3.8.20 and torch = 2.10 numpy = 1.24.3
